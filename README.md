# Office365ProPlus builds and versions
 
Creating reports of Office 365 ProPlus(Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise) installations  is not an easy way. Current versions(YYMM) are only visable on [Microsoft page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/officeupdates/update-history-microsoft365-apps-by-date). 
To automate reports crating I made a script that can translate builds to versions.
